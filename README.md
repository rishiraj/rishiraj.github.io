### 💡 Who I Am

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer currently leading AI development at **IntelliTek**, where I focus on using **Generative AI** to enhance the healthcare domain — automating clinical workflows like SOAP note generation, extracting structured data from unstructured conversations, and ensuring HIPAA-compliant ML pipelines.

As a **triple Google Developer Expert** in **Machine Learning**, **Cloud**, and **Kaggle**, I bring both depth and breadth to real-world AI systems. My work sits at the intersection of **NLP**, **Speech Technologies**, and **Medical AI**.
